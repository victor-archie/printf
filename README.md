**A custom _printf function implementation**


The _printf function is a custom implementation of the standard C library 
function printf. It allows you to format and output text to the console or 
other output streams.

This program implements a custom printf function that supports the following conversion specifiers:

    **%c** : prints a single character
    **%s** : prints a null-terminated string
    **%d**, %i, %u, %o, %x, %X : prints a signed/unsigned integer in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal format
    **%p** : prints a pointer address
    **%S** : prints a string with non-printable characters represented in the format \xXX (where XX is the ASCII code value in hexadecimal, always two characters in uppercase)

The program also supports the following flag characters:

    **0** : left-pads the output with zeros instead of spaces
    **#** : left-justifies the output within the given field width
    **+** : always prints the sign of a signed number (+ or -)
    **space** : prints a space before a positive number (overrides the + flag)

The program also supports the following length modifiers:

    **h** : short (for integers)
    **l** : long (for integers)

In addition, the program supports the following custom conversion specifiers:

    **%r** : prints the reversed string
    **%R** : prints the rot13'ed string

The maximum field width that can be specified is 1024 characters. This buffer size is used to minimize the number of calls to the write function.
